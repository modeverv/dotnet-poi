## 2026-05-05 01:54 JST - XML parity CI drift

- GitHub Actions `Verify XML Parity Fixtures` failed because `XmlParityFixtureGeneratorTest` rewrites `xlsm-basic` by opening `tests/test-files/example.xlsm` with Apache POI and saving it through `XSSFWorkbook.write()`.
- The committed `xlsm-basic__*.xml` fixtures are intentionally hybrid: DotnetPoi regenerates workbook/content-types/relationships but preserves unchanged macro workbook parts such as doc props, styles, shared strings, worksheets, drawings, theme, and calcChain.
- Fix: updated `generateMacroEnabledXlsm` to first generate the POI package, then overlay the preserved xlsm entries from the source workbook so CI regenerates the same hybrid fixture set.
- Verification: `dotnet test tests/DotnetPoi.XSSF.Tests/DotnetPoi.XSSF.Tests.csproj --filter XmlParity_XlsmBasic_MatchesPoiFixtures` passes. Local Maven is not installed, so the exact GitHub workflow command still needs CI or a Maven-equipped environment.
